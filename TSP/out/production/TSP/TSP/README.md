# TSP
School project: TSP solver, two-opt and simulated annealing

Conditions:

Students are provided with a set of 10 instances (ALGO_cup_2018_problems.zip file attached. Notice that the Euclidean coordinates (xi,yi) are real numbers but the computed dij distances must be integer. In the zip file for some problems the best known solution is also reported). For each instance students have to compute the shortest possible tour. Students are allowed to run their algorithm on each instance how many times they like with the constraint that each run can not be longer than 3 minutes on a single processor. Results must be replicable (in case we need to check the validity of your solutions) so please keep all the parameters of your best runs (remember also to store random seeds).
